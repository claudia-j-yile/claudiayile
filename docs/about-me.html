    <p> Claudia Yile is a digital media artist and film producer from Northern California now based in West Harlem. Their video work has screened in multiple cities across the world, including Berlin, Barcelona, and Los Angeles. 
        <br/> As an artist concerned with the advent of civilizational demise, Yile’s digital worlds linger in the space between human and mere abstraction through absurdity and high-concept conceits. 
        <br/> In their free time, Yile runs an NFT meme page @neet_femcel_thoughts on instagram, is studying full-stack web development, and maintains a Western astrological consultation practice.
